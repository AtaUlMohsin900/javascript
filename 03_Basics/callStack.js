/* Call Stack in JavaScript is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in the program. 
It follows a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last function added to the stack is the 
first one to be executed. When a function is invoked, it's pushed onto the stack. Once the function completes,
 it's popped off the stack.
