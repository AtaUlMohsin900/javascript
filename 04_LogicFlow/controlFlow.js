/* Control flow in JavaScript refers to the order in which individual statements, instructions, or functions are 
executed in a script. By default, JavaScript executes code from top to bottom. However, control flow can be altered 
using conditional statements like `if`, `else if`, and `else` to execute specific blocks of code based on conditions.
 Loops like `for`, `while`, and `do...while` allow repeating tasks until a certain condition is met. Additionally,
  keywords like `break`, `continue`, and `return` provide finer control over the execution flow, while `try...catch`
   handles exceptions to manage errors gracefully.*/
